  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  This example uses a serial menu system to demonstrate all the various functions of the
  Qwiic MP3 Trigger.

  Open the serial terminal at 115200 to get the available menu of commands.

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug in headphones
  Make sure the SD card is in the socket and has some MP3s in the root directory
  Don't have a USB cable connected right now
  If needed, attach a Qwiic Shield to your Arduino/Photon/ESP32 or other
  Plug the Qwiic device onto an available Qwiic port
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud
