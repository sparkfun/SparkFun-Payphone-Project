  This example plays the first track on the SD card.

  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15165

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug in headphones
  Make sure the SD card is in the socket and has some MP3s in the root directory
  Don't have a USB cable connected to the Qwiic MP3 Trigger right now
  If needed, attach a Qwiic Shield to your Arduino/Photon/ESP32 or other
  Plug the Qwiic device onto an available Qwiic port
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud
